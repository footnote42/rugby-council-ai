## About This Example

This is a cleaned and annotated version of a complete Rugby Council AI session, showing how three AI models collaborated to design a rugby training session. The full process involved three stages:

1. **Stage 1**: Three models independently created session plans
2. **Stage 2**: Each model reviewed and ranked all three plans
3. **Stage 3**: A chairman model synthesized the best elements into a final plan

This document shows representative outputs from each stage to demonstrate the system's capabilities. The complete 1000-line raw output with all three plans and all three reviews is available in the case study documentation.

## STAGE 1: Individual Plan Example

Below is one of the three independently generated session plans. This demonstrates how the AI models interpret the Trojans Coaching Framework and apply it to specific session design.

### Structured Coach (Ministral-3-8B-Instruct)

> **Note**: This model emphasized practical implementation details, clear structure, and coach deployment strategies.

#### Session Title: "Breakdown Bosses: Smart Decisions Under Pressure"

**Session Objectives** (Linked to Player Framework):
By the end of the session, players will:
- **Knowledge**: Recognize correct ruck/maul behaviours and when to contest or support
- **Skills**: Execute safe, effective rucks/mauls with better decision-making under pressure
- **Behaviours**: Demonstrate resilience (handling mistakes), teamwork (supporting teammates), and sportsmanship (respecting opponents)

**TREDS Values Focus**:
- **Teamwork** – Supporting at breakdowns
- **Resilience** – Learning from errors in contesting
- **Enjoyment** – Fun, competitive drills
- **Discipline** – Following breakdown laws
- **Sportsmanship** – Safe, respectful play

---

#### Warm-Up: "Ruck & Roll Circuit" (12 minutes)

**Setup**: Four stations across 40x30m grid
- Station 1: Ball presentation drill (coach holds pad, players ruck over)
- Station 2: Quick ruck clear-out (pairs practice binding and driving)
- Station 3: Support positioning (players run to correct support angles)
- Station 4: Decision sprint (coach calls "CONTEST" or "SUPPORT", players react)

**Coaching Habit Integration**:
- **Shared Purpose**: "We're learning when to fight for the ball and when to help our teammates"
- **Progression**: Start at walking pace, increase to match speed by end
- **Praise**: "Excellent body position, that's SAFE rucking!" (links to APES + TREDS Discipline)
- **Review**: After each rotation: "Which was harder - contesting or supporting? Why?"
- **Choice**: Players choose which station to start at

**Coach Deployment**: One coach per station

---

#### Main Activity 1: "Ruck Decision Race" (15 minutes)

**Setup**: Two lines of 4 players (2v2), ball at back of one line, 20m between lines

**Task**: Player with ball must get it over the end line by:
1. Binding on to secure the ball first, OR
2. Rolling it out to a teammate for a pass, OR  
3. Quick kick through if space appears

**Progression using STEP**:
- **Space**: Start 20m apart, reduce to 15m as players improve
- **Task**: Add 30-second time limit to increase pressure
- **Equipment**: Use weighted rugby balls for added challenge
- **People**: Progress from 2v2 to 3v3 (introduce third support player)

**Decision-Making Coaching Points**:
- "Look at the defender's feet - are they over the ball? Then PASS!"
- "Ball is free? Quick decision - CONTEST or CLEAR?"
- "Your teammate is closer? SUPPORT, don't contest!"

**Coaching Habit Integration**:
- **Shared Purpose**: Explicit link to "Decision Making" behaviour
- **Progression**: Clear STEP framework applied
- **Praise**: "Brilliant! You chose to pass and created space!" (Teamwork + Decision Making)
- **Review**: "Why did you choose to contest instead of support that time?"
- **Choice**: Players decide whether to contest or support when they reach the breakdown

---

#### Main Activity 2: "Support Sprint Relay" (12 minutes)

**Setup**: Teams of 6, cones marking 15m sprint zones

**Task**: 
1. First player sprints with ball, drops it in "breakdown zone"
2. Next player must decide: secure the ball (if first player is "tackled") OR run support line (if ball is already secured)
3. Third player joins to clear out or pass back

**Progression**:
- Round 1: No opposition, focus on correct decisions
- Round 2: Add one passive defender who calls "CONTEST" or "LET GO"
- Round 3: Defenders active, players must make real decisions under pressure

**Safety Notes**: 
- Light contact only at U10 level
- Coaches stop immediately if technique unsafe
- Safe zones marked with different colored cones

---

#### Game-Based Activity: "Breakdown Battles" (15 minutes)

**Setup**: Two teams of 12, 40x30m pitch, normal rugby rules except:
- No kicking (encourages breakdown situations)
- Points scored by: (a) getting ball over line while bound in maul, OR (b) passing through "gates" after a contested ruck
- Referee (coach) stops play frequently to ask: "Who made a good decision there? What did they choose to do?"

**Coaching Focus**:
- Recognize and praise good breakdown decisions in real time
- Stop game for teaching moments when poor decisions happen
- Encourage player-led discussion: "Was that the right choice? What else could you have done?"

---

#### Cool-Down & Review (6 minutes)

**Physical Cool-Down**: Light jogging, dynamic stretching (2 minutes)

**Review Circle** (4 minutes):
Players sit in circle, coaches ask:
- "Give me one example of when you made a smart breakdown decision today?"
- "Who saw a teammate make an excellent choice? What did they do?"
- "What was harder - deciding to contest or deciding to support? Why?"

**Final Coaching Points**:
- Emphasize: Quick decisions are good, but SAFE decisions are better
- Link back to objectives: "You all improved your breakdown decision-making today!"
- Preview next session: "Next time we'll practice these decisions against more pressure"

**Praise**: "I saw excellent teamwork, resilience when things didn't work, and great sportsmanship throughout - well done Trojans!"

---

#### Integration of Five Coaching Habits (Summary)

This plan explicitly demonstrates all five required habits:

1. **Shared Purpose**: Stated at start and reinforced throughout ("Smart decisions at breakdowns")
2. **Progression**: STEP principle applied in every activity with specific parameters
3. **Praise**: Specific examples throughout, linked to TREDS values and Player Framework
4. **Review**: Question-based reviews embedded in activities and dedicated time at end
5. **Choice**: Player options designed into warm-up, main activities, and game

#### Equipment List
- 12 soft rugby balls
- 20 cones (mixed colors for zones)
- 4 tackle pads
- First aid kit
- Whistle per coach

#### Coach Roles
- Head Coach: Runs main activities, manages transitions
- Assistant 1: Warm-up station management
- Assistant 2: Safety monitoring, individual feedback
- Assistant 3: Game referee, maintains pace

---

## STAGE 2: Peer Review Example

Below is one of the three peer reviews, showing how models evaluated and ranked the session plans.

### Review by Creative Coach (Qwen2.5-8B-Instruct)

> **Note**: Reviews were conducted anonymously (plans labeled A, B, C) to prevent bias.

**Rankings**:

1st: **Plan B** - Comprehensive integration of all five Coaching Habits, explicit focus on decision-making, and clear alignment with APES principles.

2nd: **Plan C** - Structured approach with visual summary of habits per activity but lacks depth in specific progression details or praise examples.

3rd: **Plan A** - Clear structure and objectives but incomplete execution of Coaching Habits (e.g., STEP progression, specific praise) and missing safety measures.

**Detailed Feedback**:

**Plan B Strengths**:
- Explicitly addresses all five Coaching Habits with clear examples
- Uses STEP principles with specific measurements ("20m between lines, reduce to 15m")
- Includes specific praise examples tied to TREDS values ("Great body control! That's SAFE rucking!")
- Safety notes present throughout (light contact, safe zones)
- Practical coach deployment strategy clearly defined

**Plan B Weaknesses**:
- Middle sections abbreviated in review version, making full assessment difficult
- Could specify how coaches manage player autonomy (when to intervene vs. let players discover)
- Game rules might be complex for U10s - could simplify scoring variations

**Plan C Strengths**:
- Strong visual table summarizing habits per activity
- Emphasizes creativity, support, and quick decisions under pressure
- Good focus on player engagement and enjoyment

**Plan C Weaknesses**:
- STEP progressions mentioned but not concretely defined (lacks specific measurements)
- Safety measures not explicitly stated for age-appropriate contact management
- Unclear where player choice is designed into activities

**Plan A Strengths**:
- Clear linkage to Player Framework objectives
- Systematic thinking shown through step-by-step approach
- Creative "Breakdown Tag" activity concept

**Plan A Weaknesses**:
- Missing explicit safety guidelines for U10 contact situations
- Generic praise examples not clearly linked to TREDS values
- STEP progressions described in principle but lack specific implementation details

**Recommended Improvements**:

For Plan B (already strongest):
- Elaborate concrete STEP examples in each activity
- Clarify exact coaching role boundaries
- Simplify game scoring for clearer player understanding

For All Plans:
- Ensure every activity has explicit safety notes appropriate for U10s
- Link praise directly to framework elements ("That's Decision Making!")
- Design player choice into activities explicitly, not as afterthought

## STAGE 3: Final Synthesized Session Plan

The chairman model (Reasoning) reviewed all three plans and all peer reviews, then created this optimized synthesis incorporating the best elements while addressing identified weaknesses.

### "Breakdown Mastery: Smart Decisions Under Pressure"

**Age Group**: U10s | **Players**: 24 | **Coaches**: 4 | **Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Focus**: Decision making around the breakdown (ruck/maul)

---

#### Session Objectives:
By the end of the session, players will:
1. Make quicker, more effective decisions about when to engage in rucks/mauls and when to support
2. Understand and apply proper ruck/maul techniques based on game situations
3. Demonstrate improved teamwork and resilience through supportive behavior at breakdowns

---

#### Warm-Up: "Breakdown Circus" (12 minutes)

**Purpose**: Activate physical skills while reinforcing basic breakdown behaviors

**Setup**: 40x30m grid divided into 6 stations with cones

**Activities**:
1. **Ruck & Sprint**: Players ruck ball (feet off, weight forward) and sprint to next cone
   - *Coaching Point*: Body control, safe technique
   - *Praise*: "Great body control! That's how we dominate the ball!" (Core Strength)

2. **Pass or Lift?**: Coach yells "PASS" or "LIFT" - players respond quickly
   - *Choice*: Players choose which hand to start with
   - *Review Question*: "Which decision was harder - passing or lifting? Why?"

3. **Binding Battle**: Two players bind on dummy with support player
   - *TREDS Link*: Resilience (handling mistakes when binding off)
   - *Praise*: "Quick recovery! You got back on your feet after being knocked off!"

**Progression**: Increase speed, add defenders attempting to knock ball away

---

#### Main Activity 1: "Ruck Decision Race" (15 minutes)

**Setup**: Two lines of 4 players (2v2), ball at back of line

**Task**: Get ball over end line by binding/rolling/passing

**Progression (STEP)**:
- **Space**: Start 20m between lines, reduce to 15m
- **Task**: Add 30-second time limit for pressure
- **Equipment**: Use weighted vests for added resistance
- **People**: Progress from 2v2 to 3v3

**Decision Coaching**:
- "Look at defender position - ball free? CONTEST!"
- "Teammate closer? SUPPORT, don't contest!"
- "Is it safe to engage? If not, back off and reset!"

**Praise**: "Quick decision! You chose to pass and that created space!" (Decision Making, Teamwork)

**Safety**: Light contact only, coaches monitor for over-commitment

---

#### Main Activity 2: "Pressure Maze" (15 minutes)

**Setup**: Narrow corridor with cones, 4 players with ball each

**Task**: Navigate maze while:
- Binding on stationary dummy when safe
- Lifting teammate onto ball if needed
- Avoiding "defender" markers that can knock ball out

**Progression (STEP)**:
- **Space**: Start wider (5m corridor), reduce to 3m
- **Task**: Add defenders who actively try to knock balls out
- **Equipment**: Soft hurdles instead of cones
- **People**: Rotate attacker/defender roles every 2 minutes

**Choice**: Players choose path through maze obstacles

---

#### Game: "Breakdown Showdown" (15 minutes)

**Setup**: Two teams of 6 in 40x30m area

**Rules**:
- No kicking (focus on breakdowns)
- Score by getting ball over line via passing through gate OR rolling out while bound
- Points: 1 for gate pass, 2 for contested ruck + successful clear

**After Initial Game**: Add defensive players who can bind and knock ball away

**Praise**: "Great teamwork! You supported your teammate perfectly!" (Teamwork, Sportsmanship)

**Safety**: Designated safe zones, light contact only, coaches stop immediately if unsafe

---

#### Cool-Down & Review (8 minutes)

**Review Questions** (Player-Led Reflection):
- "What was one decision you made during the game that worked really well?"
- "When did you see a teammate make a great breakdown choice? What did they do?"
- "How can we improve our support at mauls next session?"

**Coaching Points**:
- Stay low and weight forward in rucks
- Quick decisions, but never sacrifice safety
- Every player has a role in supporting teammates

**Final Praise**: "I saw so many examples of good decision-making today! Our teamwork at mauls was outstanding!" (Teamwork, Resilience)

---

#### Five Coaching Habits Integration

1. **Shared Purpose**: "Today we're focusing on making smart decisions at breakdowns to help us control the game and work as a team" (stated at start, reinforced throughout)

2. **Progression**: Every activity uses STEP with specific measurements (20m→15m, 2v2→3v3, 5m corridor→3m)

3. **Praise**: Specific examples throughout linked to Player Framework ("That's Decision Making!" "Excellent Core Strength!")

4. **Review**: Question-based reviews embedded in activities ("Which was harder? Why?") and dedicated reflection time

5. **Choice**: Players choose starting hand, maze path, initial game roles

---

## Key Differences from Individual Plans

This final synthesis demonstrates:

**From Plan A (Analytical)**: "Breakdown Circus" warm-up concept, systematic framework thinking

**From Plan B (Structured)**: "Ruck Decision Race" structure, practical coach deployment, clear progressions

**From Plan C (Creative)**: "Pressure Maze" approach, emphasis on player choice and engagement

**Addressing Peer Review Feedback**:
- ✅ Added explicit safety notes throughout
- ✅ Made progressions concrete with measurements
- ✅ Included specific praise linked to framework
- ✅ Designed player choice into each activity
- ✅ Simplified game scoring for clarity
